- If the problem persists, consider reflashing the firmware

#### Default Credentials

If you need to reset to factory defaults:
- **Default SSID**: `Luna_Sailing`
- **Default Password**: None (open network)

These defaults are restored when:
- Fresh firmware is uploaded without previous settings
- Flash memory is cleared or corrupted
- Factory reset is performed using the BOOT button (hold for 5 seconds)

**Note**: Factory reset functionality is now implemented using the ESP32's BOOT button. Hold the BOOT button for 5 seconds to reset all settings to defaults.

### Factory Reset

The Luna Sailing Dashboard includes a hardware-based factory reset feature that can restore all settings to their default values without requiring firmware reflashing or computer connection.

#### How to Perform Factory Reset

1. **Locate the BOOT Button**
   - Find the BOOT button on your ESP32 development board
   - This is usually labeled "BOOT" and is typically the smaller button (not the RESET button)
   - On most ESP32 DEVKIT boards, it's located near the USB connector

2. **Perform the Reset**
   - **Press and hold** the BOOT button
   - **Keep holding** for exactly **5 seconds**
   - The built-in LED will start blinking to indicate the button press is detected
   - The LED will blink faster as you approach the 5-second mark
   - **Release** the button after 5 seconds

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - **Initial press**: LED turns on solid
   - **During hold**: LED blinks progressively faster
   - **Factory reset triggered**: LED flashes rapidly 10 times
   - **Reset complete**: LED turns off

4. **What Gets Reset**
   - **WiFi Settings**: Network name returns to "Luna_Sailing", password removed (open network)
   - **Network Security**: Returns to open network (no password required)
   - **Sensor Data**: All historical data and maximum values cleared
   - **Dashboard Settings**: All customizations reset to defaults

#### After Factory Reset

1. **Automatic WiFi Restart**: The ESP32 will automatically restart its WiFi with default settings
2. **Reconnection Required**: 
   - Disconnect from the current WiFi network
   - Look for "Luna_Sailing" network (open, no password)
   - Connect to the new network
   - Navigate to `http://192.168.4.1`
3. **Security Setup**: Immediately configure a secure password through the dashboard settings
4. **Data Collection**: Sensor data collection will resume with fresh/cleared history

#### When to Use Factory Reset

- **Lost WiFi Password**: Can't remember the WiFi credentials you set
- **Network Issues**: WiFi settings got corrupted or causing connection problems
- **Starting Fresh**: Want to clear all data and start with default settings
- **Device Handover**: Preparing the device for someone else to use
- **Troubleshooting**: Eliminating custom settings as a source of problems

#### Troubleshooting Factory Reset

- **Button not responding**: Make sure you're pressing the BOOT button, not the RESET button
- **LED not blinking**: Check that the ESP32 is powered on and the firmware is running
- **Reset not completing**: Ensure you hold the button for the full 5 seconds
- **Still can't connect**: Try power cycling the ESP32 after the reset
- **Settings not cleared**: If problems persist, consider reflashing the firmware

## Development

### Sensor Calibration and Configuration

#### GPS Module (NEO-7M)

1. **Initial Setup**
   - The GPS module requires a clear view of the sky to acquire a satellite fix
   - For best results, position the antenna horizontally with an unobstructed view
   - Initial satellite acquisition can take 30-90 seconds in ideal conditions, or longer in poor conditions
   - The blue LED on the GPS module will blink when it has a fix

2. **Configuration Options**
   - The GPS update rate is set to 1Hz by default (in `src/sensors/gps.cpp`)
   - To modify GPS settings, you can adjust the following parameters:
     ```cpp
     // Change update rate (default is 1Hz)
     const int GPS_UPDATE_RATE = 1000; // in milliseconds
     
     // Change serial baud rate if needed
     const int GPS_BAUD_RATE = 9600;
     ```

#### Accelerometer (ADXL345)

1. **Calibration Process**
   - The accelerometer needs calibration for accurate tilt measurements
   - To calibrate:
     1. Position the ESP32 and accelerometer in a perfectly level position
     2. Navigate to the dashboard's Settings tab
     3. Click "Calibrate Accelerometer"
     4. Wait for the calibration to complete (about 5 seconds)
     5. The calibration values are stored in the ESP32's flash memory

2. **Manual Calibration**
   - If automatic calibration doesn't provide satisfactory results, you can manually adjust the offset values:
     ```cpp
     // In src/sensors/accelerometer.cpp
     const float X_OFFSET = 0.0;  // Replace with your calibration value
     const float Y_OFFSET = 0.0;  // Replace with your calibration value
     const float Z_OFFSET = 0.0;  // Replace with your calibration value
     ```

3. **Mounting Considerations**
   - Mount the accelerometer with the X-axis aligned with the fore-aft axis of the boat
   - The Y-axis should be aligned with the port-starboard axis
   - The Z-axis should be pointing upward
   - If physical alignment isn't possible, you can adjust the axis orientation in software:
     ```cpp
     // In src/sensors/accelerometer.cpp
     const bool SWAP_X_Y = false;  // Set to true to swap X and Y axes
     const bool INVERT_X = false;  // Set to true to invert X axis readings
     const bool INVERT_Y = false;  // Set to true to invert Y axis readings
     const bool INVERT_Z = false;  // Set to true to invert Z axis readings
     ```

#### Wind Sensor

1. **Calibration**
   - The ultrasonic wind sensor should be calibrated according to manufacturer instructions
   - For most sensors, this involves:
     1. Mounting the sensor in a stable position
     2. Navigating to the dashboard's Settings tab
     3. Clicking "Calibrate Wind Sensor"
     4. Following the on-screen instructions to rotate the sensor
     5. Saving the calibration data

2. **Configuration Options**
   - If using a different model than the default, you may need to adjust the RS485 communication parameters:
     ```cpp
     // In src/sensors/wind.cpp
     const int WIND_SENSOR_ADDRESS = 1;    // Modbus address of the sensor
     const int WIND_UPDATE_RATE = 1000;    // Update rate in milliseconds
     const int WIND_SENSOR_BAUDRATE = 9600; // Baud rate for RS485 communication
     ```

3. **Mounting Position**
   - Mount the wind sensor at the highest practical point for accurate readings
   - Ensure it's away from obstructions that could cause wind shadow or turbulence
   - For powerboats or when running with engines, be aware that exhaust gases can affect readings

### Project Structure

- `/src`: Main C++ code for ESP32 (BLE server and sensor management)
- `/data/www`: Web dashboard files (legacy - now hosted externally)
  - `/css`: Stylesheets
  - `/js`: JavaScript files (including BLE connection logic)
  - `/images`: Icons and graphics
- `/include`: Header files
- `/lib`: Libraries

**Note:** The `/data/www` folder contains the web application files for reference and local development, but in the new architecture, these files should be hosted externally (e.g., GitHub Pages) rather than uploaded to the ESP32's filesystem.

### Building and Uploading

#### Using VS Code Tasks (Recommended)

VS Code with PlatformIO extension provides several tasks that can be executed from the UI:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) to open the command palette
2. Type "Tasks: Run Task" and select it
3. Choose one of the following tasks:
