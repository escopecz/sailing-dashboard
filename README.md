A modern React-based sailing dashboard with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity for real-time sailing data monitoring.

## Features

- üõ∞Ô∏è **Real-time GPS Speed** - Monitor vessel speed with satellite count
- üí® **Wind Data** - Apparent and true wind speed/direction with visual compass
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Heel Angle** - Real-time tilt monitoring with visual gauge
- üì± **Progressive Web App** - Install on mobile devices for offline use
- üîÑ **Live BLE Connection** - Connect directly to ESP32 Luna Sailing device
- üìä **Modern UI** - Responsive dashboard with glass-morphism design

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production:**

## ESP32 Compatibility

This dashboard is designed to work with the Luna Sailing ESP32 firmware that transmits data via BLE with these characteristics:

- **Service UUID:** `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc`
- **Data UUID:** `87654321-4321-4321-4321-cba987654321`
- **Command UUID:** `11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555`
- **Device Name:** `Luna_Sailing`

## Data Format

The ESP32 sends compact JSON data:
```json
{
  "gSpd": 1.2,    // GPS Speed (knots)
  "gSat": 8,      // GPS Satellites
  "wSpd": 15.3,   // Wind Speed (knots)
  "wDir": 45,     // Wind Direction (degrees)
  "tilt": -5.2    // Heel Angle (degrees, negative = port)
}
```

## Development

Built with:
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Web Bluetooth API** for BLE connectivity
- **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for responsive layout
