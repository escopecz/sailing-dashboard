Luna Sailing Dashboard - Hardware Documentation:

- RS485_Breakout_v10.pdf: Documentation for RS485 to UART converter module
- Ultrasonic Wind Speed and Direction Sensor(RS485).doc.pdf: Wind sensor documentation
- adxl345-ep.pdf: Accelerometer documentation (legacy - now using BNO080)

Wind Sensor Notes:
The system automatically detects between two common ultrasonic wind sensor formats:
- IEEE754 Format: 9600 baud, 8E1, registers 0x0001, IEEE 754 float encoding
- Integer Format: 4800 baud, 8N1, registers 0x0000, integer√ó100 encoding

No manual configuration required - detection happens at startup.

A header file is a file containing C declarations and macro definitions
to be shared between several project source files. You request the use of a
header file in your project source file (C, C++, etc) located in `src` folder
by including it, with the C preprocessing directive `#include'.

```src/main.c

#include "header.h"

int main (void)
{
 ...
}
```

Including a header file produces the same results as copying the header file
into each source file that needs it. Such copying would be time-consuming
and error-prone. With a header file, the related declarations appear
in only one place. If they need to be changed, they can be changed in one
place, and programs that include the header file will automatically use the
new version when next recompiled. The header file eliminates the labor of
finding and changing all the copies as well as the risk that a failure to
find one copy will result in inconsistencies within a program.

In C, the convention is to give header files names that end with `.h'.
